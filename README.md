# golang-dev

Repository for my personal golang development

* Dockerfile allows you to build a docker image that you can ssh into. It drops you into a tmux session. If you disconnect and reconnect to the running container you are reconnected to the previous tmux session.
* To build run `docker build --tag golang-dev`
